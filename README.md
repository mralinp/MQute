**MQute** is a minimal, async-first MQTT framework for Python — inspired by FastAPI, built on top of `paho-mqtt`.  
It lets you define MQTT topic handlers with decorators, parse payloads with Pydantic, and focus on clean, expressive code.

> **MQute = MQ(TT) + Cuteness** — because MQTT can be elegant, too.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧭 **Decorator-based routing** like `@app.sub("topic")`
- ⚡ **Async-first**, powered by `asyncio` and `paho-mqtt`
- 🧪 **Typed payload parsing** via `pydantic`
- 🎛️ **Startup/shutdown hooks**
- 🔌 **Pluggable** and lightweight core
- 🐍 **Pure Python**, no external broker dependencies

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📦 Installation (Coming soon)

```bash
pip install mqute
```

### 🎯 Basic Usage

```python
from mqute import MQute, Router, JsonResponse
from mqute.credentials import UserPassCredential
from pydantic import BaseModel

BROKER_URL = "mqtt://test.hivemq.com"
# Create a router instance
app = MQute(
    url=BROKER_URL,
    port=1883,
    # Use UserPassCredential for authentication
    credentials=UserPassCredential(
        client_id="headquarter",
        username="admin",
        password="password"
    ))

# Define your payload model
class SensorData(BaseModel):
    temperature: float
    humidity: int

@app.on_connect()
def on_connect():
    print("Print connected!")

@app.on_disconnect()
def on_disconnect(status):
    print(f"Disconnected error: {status.error}")


# Subscribe to a topic
@app.sub("sensors/+/data")
async def handle_sensor_data(request):
    # Parse the payload
    data = await request.json(SensorData)

    # Process the data
    print(f"Received data from {request.topic}: {data}")

    # Return a response
    return JsonResponse({"status": "received"})

salon_router = Router(prefix="/salon")

@salon_router.sub("/{deviceID}")
def device_handler(request, deviceID: str):
    print (f"received data from device {deviceID}")
    return JsonResponse({"status": "received"})

app.include_router(salon_router, prefix="/device")

app.start()
```

## Project Directory Structure

Some directories (such as `mosquitto/log/`, `mosquitto/data/`, and `mosquitto/password/`) are required for Mosquitto to run, but are ignored by git for security and cleanliness. To ensure these directories exist in fresh clones, a `.gitkeep` file is placed in each. You can safely leave these files in place.

```
mosquitto/
  config/           # Mosquitto configuration files
  log/              # Mosquitto log files (gitignored, with .gitkeep)
  data/             # Mosquitto data files (gitignored, with .gitkeep)
  password/         # Mosquitto password file (gitignored, with .gitkeep)
  certs/            # TLS certificates
```

> **Note:** If you remove the `.gitkeep` files, git will not track these empty directories.
